# Leakage-safe baseline study

**Study id:** `elevated-sbp-forward-v1`
**Contract:** `datalife-synthetic-longitudinal` `0.1.0`

Depends on the generator and tables from
[#2](https://github.com/datalife-ehealth/datalife-analytics-downstream/issues/2) /
[PR #5](https://github.com/datalife-ehealth/datalife-analytics-downstream/pull/5).
See [generator.md](generator.md) for how those tables are produced.

## Question

Predict whether a synthetic subject's *later* encounter has elevated systolic blood
pressure (SBP >= 140 mmHg) using only *earlier* encounters of that same subject.
Covariates: sex, age band, region, last encounter type, prior BMI, prior SBP, and
structural missingness rates for those markers.

This is a labelling rule on generated data. It is not a diagnostic definition, a
fairness evaluation, or an operational signal.

## Why this split

- **Subject-aware:** each `subject_key` is assigned wholly to train or test from a
  seeded shuffle. Tests fail if any subject appears on both sides.
- **Time-aware:** features are built from encounters strictly before the outcome
  timestamp. Tests fail if a feature timestamp is on or after the outcome, or if a
  buggy split puts a subject's later rows in train and earlier rows in test.
- **Train-only impute:** numeric medians are fit on train and applied to test.
- **Contract first:** `validate()` from the v0.1.0 contract runs before any split
  or fit. Schema mismatch and missing columns fail closed.

## Naive comparator

A constant predictor equal to the training positive rate (hard label = majority
class). The logistic baseline is reported next to it, not instead of it.

## One command

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]" -c constraints.txt
datalife-baseline --seed 20260101 --subjects 80 --split-seed 7 \
    --out reports/generated
```

That run generates a v0.1.0 cohort (or you can pass `--input` to a directory written
by `datalife-fixtures generate`), builds forward examples, splits by subject, fits
both models, and writes `metrics.json` plus `report.md` under `reports/generated/`
(git-ignored). Against the committed fixture:

```bash
datalife-baseline --input tests/fixtures --prefix synthetic_v0_1_0_ \
    --split-seed 7 --out reports/generated
```

The fixture is small on purpose; use a generated cohort for less noisy metrics.

## Adding a model without breaking the contract

1. Keep contract `0.1.0` unless the field set actually changes.
2. Add a fit/predict object next to `NaivePrevalence` / `RidgeLogistic` that consumes
   the encoded rows from `FeatureEncoder`.
3. Register it in `run_study` so it shows up under `payload["models"]` beside the
   naive comparator.
4. Do not move imputation onto the test set. Do not split by row if a subject would
   land on both sides.

Generated reports, fitted weights, and notebook outputs stay out of Git.
